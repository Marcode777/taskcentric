npm init -y to create package.json

npm i -S react, react-dom    (npm i -S, is a quick way of npm install --save)

npm i -D babel-core babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react react-hot-loader webpack webpack-dev-server                    (npm i -D, is a quick way of npm install --save-dev)

then npm i -g webpack webpack-dev-server (npm i -g, is a quick way of npm installing globally)

sidenote: for the webpack.config.js file, differences are in loaders, instead of react-hot it is react-hot-loader/webpack, but here I revised it yet again from react-hot-loader/webpack to react-hot-loader

To create a production bundle, use `npm run build`.

With the form validation, there is a slight naming convention issue (with the word task) which allows an entry to be made twice before validation starts.
